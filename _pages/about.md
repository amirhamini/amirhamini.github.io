<h3>Biography</h3>

I obtained my B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering at Iran University of Science & Technology in Tehran, where I spent the first 23 years of my life. In Fall 2010, I moved to Seattle to pursue my education as a Master's student at University of Washington, graduated in Summer 2012, and started my Ph.D. program the following Fall.

I received my Ph.D. Degree from University of Washington in Winter 2017.
My Ph.D. research, advised by G. M. Homsy and James J. Riley, is directed towards mathematical modeling and numerical analysis of interfacial phenomena, in particular evaporation of liquid droplets on both flat and curved solid substrates.

Along with Mechanical engineering research, I am interested in teaching and programming. My teaching experience is concentrated on fluid mechanics and advanced mathematics related courses, in both graduate and undergraduate levels. My focus in programming includes scientific computing, data science, data visualization, and computational geometry.
