<h3>Education</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering, University of Washington, 2017 </li>
    <li>M.S. in Mechanical Engineering, University of Washington, 2012</li>
    <li>B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, Iran University of Science & Technology, 2010</li>
</ul>


I obtained my B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering at Iran University of Science & Technology in Tehran, where I spent the first 23 years of my life. In Fall 2010, I moved to Seattle to pursue my education as a Master's student at University of Washington, graduated in Summer 2012, and started my PhD program the following Fall.

My PhD research advised by G. M. Homsy and James J. Riley is directed towards mathematical modeling and numerical analysis of interfacial phenomena, in particular evaporation of liquid droplets on both flat and curved solid substrates.

Along with Mechanical engineering research, I am interested in teaching and programming. I have a wide range of teaching experience as mentor, teaching assistant, and instructor for fluid mechanics and advanced mathematics related courses in both graduate and undergraduate levels. My focus in programming includes scientific computing, data science, data visualization, and computational geometry.
